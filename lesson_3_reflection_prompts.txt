When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want the files accessible from other computers, or when collaborating with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To make sure that I only publish finished things, especially if I am collaborating with others.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is used only in GitHub context and is like a clone of another repository, maintaining the link to the original. Used while using GitHub to credit or link to the original author.

    Clone is simply a copy of a repository, whether locally or from a remote server to a machine. Used to work based on existing information, or to collaborate based on existing material.

    Branches are used within the same repository to create different versions of a code, or work from different people.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

Having the possibility to compare the new potential changes introduced by people collaborating with you

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would create the same repository for the members of my team. It would be easier to share the code, harder to track the changes if they are a lot

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
